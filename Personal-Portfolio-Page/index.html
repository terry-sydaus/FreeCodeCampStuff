	<h1>Hi, I'm Terry</h1>
	<div class='lead'>
	  <p>
	  Welcome to my personal portfolio page!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  I have created this page because I am teaching myself to become a Full Stack
	  Developer through various online resources and tools, one of which is 
	  <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org'>Free Code Camp</a>,
	  <!-- Don't place the closing a tag on a separate line if you want the comma that follows
     it to display as you intend it to (ie. exactly adjacent to the last letter of the link
     text (ie. Camp, and not Camp ,) -->
     an amazing online platform that allows 
     <strong>anyone</strong> to earn a Full Stack
     Development Certificate by completing a number of projects associated with 6 modules.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  This website is one such project and in the fullness of time I will use this page to showcase my skills,
	  knowledge and capabilities in this space, by posting examples of my work and projects that 
	  I have completed.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Feel free to have a look around and let me know what you think.

	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<div class='lead'>
	  <p>
	  My name is Terry Murphy and I am a Chemical Engineer that has worked in the inudstrial automation space
	  for many years. In my current position, I am responsible for the Process Control Systems that control
	  two chemical plants in Sydney, Australia. This encompasses system hardware and software accountabilities
	  and provides me with the opportunity to get paid to do something that I thoroughly enjoy.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  I have ambitions to continue to apply the automation skills and knowledge I have acquired to every aspect of
	  human endeavour where automation is being applied, without limiting my opportunities to the industrial
	  space. I have particular interest in the application of Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence and 
	  would one day love to end up contributing significantly to projects associated with driverless cars, 
	  general business automation, medical diagnostic improvements, data mining, to name but a few. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  With this vision in mind, I realised that my skill set needed to expand to allow me to prepare for this
	  next stage of my working life. And this is where Free Code Camp (FCC) and its founder, Quincy Larson, come to
	  the fore, by providing this brilliant online environment to allow someone like me (anyone in fact), 
	  to equip themselves with the skills and knowledge to get them more than started on their way to becoming
	  a Full Stack Developer.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  And so this is how and why I can be in this position now, creating my own personal portfolio page
	  as part of the FCC's Responsive Web Design module. I have worked very hard at this since starting 
	  and am getting better at this the more I spend on it (funny that!), but acknowledge that I am still
	  for the most part clueless at the current time. Having said that, I am very proud of what I have
	  achieved so far and am pretty stoked that I have created this page using plain old HTML and CSS, without
	  any frameworks (Bootstrap, jQuery etc.) - this is something that I wanted to do while learning the
	  fundamentals of this craft (ie. not become dependent on a framework).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  I have learned so much along the way thus far in my journey. I am not rushing at all.
	  Feel free to check out some of my responsive web design projects that I have completed below or 
	  by clicking on the <a href='#projects'>Work</a> link in the Navigation Bar at the top of this page.
