      <li><a href='Product-Landing-Page/index.html'>Product Landing Page</a>
	<p>I learned so much doing this project:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Collapsing Margins</li>
	  <li>Top padding for links to navigate to correct place when page has a fixed navbar</li>
	  <li>Flexbox - just love this</li>
	  <li>Responsive design and media queries</li>
	  <li>Image sizes</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li><a href='Tech-Doc-Page/index.html'>Technical Documentation Page</a>
	<p>My learning journey in continuing with this project. Of particular interest was:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>How to include code snippets in a web page</li>
	  <li>The specific layout of the code in the html and the "pre" element's role in achieving this</li>
	  <li>The css "white-space" property and the value of this being set to "pre-wrap"</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li><a href='Personal-Portfolio-Page/index.html'>Personal Portfolio Page</a>
	<p>I am pretty happy with this effort. It was a very rewarding learning experience creating this page especially with respect to the 
	following:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Building this site with plain old vanilla HTML and CSS with no frameworks</li>
	  <li>Reinforcing the sound practice of building sites with the <strong>mobile first </strong> approach.</li>
	  <li>Improving my overall understanding of web site design and implementation with flex box, fonts and icons from 
	    external sources, CSS selectors, class and id assignments to HTML elements etc.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

	This project was enjoyable and gave me an opportunity to put my new found React knowledge to the test.
	I spent quite a lot of time reading about React and doing other tutorials before starting this project which made it 
	easier than it otherwise would have been to complete this project. I really like React and this project gave me the 
	opportunity to consolidate the following knowledge:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Using create-react-app to set up working environment to build a React App.</li>
	  <li>Creating stateless functional components.</li>
	  <li>Creating stateful class components.</li>
	  <li>Using ES6 features such as arrow functions and destructuring to create variables from an object.</li>
	  <li>Passing props to lower level components.</li>
	  <li>Defining, referring to and setting state.</li>
	  <li>Fetching data from a remote location (GitHub gist) and using JSON parse methods to utilise fetched data.</li>
	  <li>Styling components with inline styles and external stylesheets.</li>
	  <li>Learning more about Git and GitHub, especially remote repositories, branching, merging changes etc.</li>
	  <li>Using npm to deploy a React App to GitHub pages.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>

    </ul>
